# Generic Questions and Constructive Feedback
List of relative generic questions to ask and suggestions to constructive feedback after a technical talk.


## Questions

* [ ] How does your work save the world?

### Related Work
* [ ] Which related approaches exist in the field?
* [ ] What are the major differences to related solutions?

### Approach
* [ ] Is the code available/open source/in form of a website?
* [ ] Can you tell what exactly was your work and what was done by students or in cooperation?
* [ ] Which part of the work is most crucial/most important to you?
* [ ] Why did you choose this aspect/component to research?

### Evaluation
* [ ] How did you evaluate/validate your results?
 * [ ] Proof, simulation, real-world data?
* [ ] Which results do you expect on use case X?
* [ ] Why did you choose this evaluation metric? Purpose? Advantages? Disadvantages? Disadvantages of others?

### Future Work
* [ ] Of course, nothing is perfect, which parts require further research?
* [ ] How can the solution be improved?
* [ ] What are the next steps?
* [ ] What are the next implementation plans (standardization, open source, API, website, library)?
* [ ] With your experience now, would you suggest to solve the problem completely different or where are adjustments necessary to improve the results?
* [ ] With your experience now, would you have set the focus differently?
* [ ] What need to be done to apply it in practice?
* [ ] What is the practical relevance?
* [ ] Who and how can one profit from the results?
* [ ] How realistic is the result (e.g. framework) in practice? Which additional entities are necessary? Which hardware/software requirements exits?
* [ ] What are the most important takeaways for companies/employees/individuals? 

### Other
* [ ] Where in the bigger picture fits your solution?
* [ ] Can an ML based approach improve the solution?
* [ ] How were the features/metrics derived/chosen?
* [ ] Who benefits from this research/findings directly?
* [ ] Are you satisfied with the solution you proposed?
* [ ] Do you see a trend regarding observations/related solutions?
* [ ] How could your work be an inspiration to other researchers?
* [ ] In which cases/scenarios can the extremes of the tradeoff work hand in hand and whereis a tradeoff really needed?
* [ ] With whom/which other fields could you cooperate in order to move forward with the topic?
* [ ] Can you explain why the result is so high/low opposite to the expectation?
* [ ] Can you quantify that or is it just qualifiable?
* [ ] Prevention, Detection, Reaction - which of these are represented in your solution? Could you extend your solution to cover the others?


## Provoking Questions (possibly topic specific)
* [ ] In the retrospective - have you really achieved your initial goals?
* [ ] Is it possible to have complete anonymity?
* [ ] Is it possible to have both privacy and attack detection simultaneously?
* [ ] Is there a more lightweight solution?
